# Web Games and Simulations

This is a collection of web-based projects made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes interactive games and physics simulations, with many being early experiments from high school while I was learning to program.

The games and simulations can be explored [here](https://aydencook.com/programming/web-games-simulations).
