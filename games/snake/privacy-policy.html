    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>
        This privacy policy applies to the Snake app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices,
        which was created by Ayden Cook (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service.
        This service is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>
    <p>
        The Application does not collect any personal information. It does, however, store a high score value
        locally on your device using local storage. This local high score data is never transmitted to the Service
        Provider or to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Application does not use any form of analytics or advertising frameworks, and it does not track user
        behavior.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</strong>
    <p>
        This Application does not collect or use precise location data of your mobile device.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
    <p>
        Since the Application does not collect any personal information, no data is ever shared with third parties.
        Local high score data is stored only on your device.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
    <p>
        You can stop all collection of information by the Application simply by uninstalling it. You may use the
        standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application
        marketplace or network.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Children</strong>
    <p>
        The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
        The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The
        Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and
        to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable
        information through the Application without permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under
        13 has provided personally identifiable information through the Application, please contact the Service
        Provider so that the necessary actions can be taken. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent
        to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may
        allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Security</strong>
    <p>
        The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However,
        since the Application does not collect any personal data and the only stored data (high score) remains
        on your device, there is no risk of third-party access to your personal information.
    </p>
    <br>

    <strong>Changes</strong>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you
        of any changes to this Policy by updating this page with the revised Privacy Policy. You are advised to
        consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use of the Application is deemed
        approval of all changes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-01-20.</p>
    <br>

    <strong>Your Consent</strong>
    <p>
        By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this
        Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.
    </p>
    <br>
